## A Case Study on the topic: **Monolith vs Serverless**

There are different ways of building applications and there isn't any perfect way. But there are ways to ensure the path taken to build software products, is as hassle-free and efficient as possible depending on the application type, its needs, and the customer/user it targets. At the end of this case study, I expect to be much clearer about my vision and find the most favorable way for my app to function behind the scenes.

> The style I chose for writing this case study is a comparative one which stacks both paths against each other for a crystal clear view of both, and why you might have to  choose over the other depending on the use case.
