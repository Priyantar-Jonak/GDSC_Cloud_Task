## A Case Study on the topic: **Monolith vs Serverless**

-----------------------------------------------------------

There are different ways of building applications and there isn't any perfect way to do it. But there are ways to ensure the path you take to build your software products is as hassle-free and efficient as possible depending on your application type, its needs, and the customer/user it targets. At the end of this case study, I expect you to be much clearer about your vision and find the most favorable way for your app to function behind the scenes.
