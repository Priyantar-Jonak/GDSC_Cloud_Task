## A Case Study on the topic: **Monolith vs Serverless**

There are different ways of building applications and there isn't any perfect way. But there are ways to ensure the path taken to build software products, is as hassle-free and efficient as possible depending on the application type, its needs, and the customer/user it targets. At the end of this case study, I expect to be much clearer about my vision and find the most favorable way for my app to function behind the scenes.

> The style I chose for writing this case study is a comparative one which stacks both paths against each other for a crystal clear view of both, and why you might have to  choose one over the other depending on the use case. 

### Architecture
#### Monolith

A monolith server-side app — also known as a monolith, is an application delivered via a single deployment, it is also available in one single endpoint and all required logic exists there.


 #### Serverless

A serverless architecture — also known as serverless computing or function as a service (FAAS), is a software design pattern where our function (a part of the microservice responsibility) is hosted by a third-party service (AWS Lambda functions, Azure functions, Firebase cloud functions, etc…), this architecture eliminates the need for server software and hardware management by the developers, the third-party service provides this automatically.
